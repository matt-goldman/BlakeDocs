# The Blake Philosophy

Blake is guided by simplicity and convention:

- Predictability over magic
- Convention over configuration
- Clarity over cleverness

## Blake's 7

1. No hidden logic
2. Folders are structure
3. Templates own complexity
4. No required config
5. Drafts are opt-in
6. No assumptions
7. Bake, don't wrangle

* Predictability over magic

* Convention over configuration

* Clarity over cleverness

* Why there’s no config system

* Blake’s “No Assumptions” rulebook
