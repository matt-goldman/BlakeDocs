# Project Structure

- .generated/ contains the output Razor files
- GeneratedContentIndex gives you typed access to content
- Your folder layout becomes your site layout

* GeneratedContentIndex and metadata

* .generated files and Blazor compilation

* Where to put what (and why it's flexible)

* Example: adding /Changelog or /Guides
