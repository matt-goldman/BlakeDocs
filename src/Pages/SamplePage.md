## Hello world!

Hello. This is a test page, generated by the Blake Blazor static site generator. Like it?

:::tip
Blake supports markdown containers, like this tip. It comes with some built-in Bootstrap styles (compatible with the default Blazor template):

* Exercise
* Warning
* Tip
* Info

Use it like this:

```markdown
   :::tip
   This is a tip container.
   :::
```

You can disable these if you don't want to use them.
:::

You can also wrap anything in a Razor component, like this custom container. By specifying a container name (note it must be in camelCase), you can create custom containers.
```markdown
    :::myContainer
    This is a custom container.
    :::
```
Blake will render this as:

```razor
   <MyContainer>
       This is a custom container.
   </MyContainer>
```

The rest is up to Blazor - just make sure you have a component named `MyContainer` in your project, with a `RenderFragment` parameter for the content.
You can see the example `MyContainer` component that was generated by Blake in the `Components` folder of this project.

> **Note:** `MyContainer` disabled on this page because I didn't init all the sample content.

## FAQ

1. Why?

I...honestly can't remember!

2. What's next?

Templating system...other features...I forget. I have a roadmap though.

3. How do I use it?

Eventually it will be a standalone CLI tool, you'll be able to use it like this:

```bash
blake init
blake bake
dotnet run
```

or

```bash
blake init
blake serve
```

## Roadmap

```bash
blake new --template my-template
blake new -t a-different-template
```

## Code Sample Test

This is a test to validate the custom Prism renderer is loaded properly. It should highlight the code in the following block:

```csharp
public static List<TocNode> BuildSiteTocNodes(List<PageModel> pages)
{
    var root = new TocNode
    {
        Id = "root",
        Text = "Root",
        Slug = "/",
        Children = []
    };

    Console.WriteLine($"Building TOC with {pages.Count} pages.");

    foreach (var page in pages.OrderBy(p => p.Slug))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing page: {page.Slug} - {page.Title}");

        var slugParts = page.Slug.Trim('/').Split('/');
        var current = root;

        for (int i = 0; i < slugParts.Length; i++)
        {
            // Skip empty segments (in case of leading/trailing slashes)
            var segment = slugParts[i];
            var isLeaf = i == slugParts.Length - 1;
            var slugPath = "/" + string.Join('/', slugParts.Take(i + 1));

            var child = current.Children.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Id == segment);

            if (child == null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Creating new TOC node: {segment} (isLeaf: {isLeaf})");

                child = new TocNode
                {
                    Id = segment,
                    Text = isLeaf ? page.Title : segment,
                    Slug = slugPath,
                    Children = []
                };
                current.Children.Add(child);
            }

            current = child;
        }
    }

    return root.Children;
}
```
