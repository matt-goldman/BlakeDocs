This will be the intro page for the deployment section (hence page order 1).

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify, Vercel, and other static hosts
- Self-host as a Blazor app
- GitHub Actions CI

* GitHub Pages

* Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

* Self-hosting as a Blazor WASM app

* Using GitHub Actions to build & deploy

* Bascially just a general assertion that Blazor WASM apps, which is what Blake produces, can be packaged as sttic web apps and distributed via any mechanis, that supports it
