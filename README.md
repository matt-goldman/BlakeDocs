# BlakeDocs

This repository contains the source code for BlakeDocs, a documentation site built with Blazor. The project is designed to provide a clean and efficient way to manage and display documentation.

Included is the documentation itself, as well as a Blake template for a documentation site. The template is designed to be easily customizable and extendable, allowing users to adapt it to their specific needs.

## Demo

See the live demo of BlakeDocs at [the live Blake documentation site](https://www.blake-ssg.org/).
